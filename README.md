The QR code component challenge is a beginner-level project from Frontend Mentor. The objective is to build a simple QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.It also emphasizes the importance of responsive design and mobile-first workflow.

## My process
This is a straightforward design. I didn't use any specialized framework for writing the solution. Plain HTML and CSS did the job.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Most of the solution is hardcoded, so it was a challenge to understand the box position. So, I used the resources from the internet to learn the basic positioning of the box. 

### Continued development

In future iterations, this project could be enhanced by incorporating dynamic QR codes for various purposes such as user authentication, branding, and more. This would add a layer of interactivity and functionality, making the component more versatile and practical for real-world applications.
